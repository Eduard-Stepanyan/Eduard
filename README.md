### Hey there! My name is Eduard.

I'm passionate about the world of machine learning and neural networks. ⚡

In the latest stage of my learning journey, I successfully completed the "Data Science Specialist" program at Yandex Practicum in November 2023. I also finished the Start ML course by KARPOV.COURSES in January 2024.

My interests include delving deep into natural language processing (NLP) and utilizing large language models (LLM). 📚

In my previous role, I used Python to automate workflow processes, which helped to reduce time and alleviate repetitive tasks for employees. 😄

Furthermore, I am constantly learning, exploring new concepts, reading books, and tackling challenges on platforms like Kaggle. 🔭

I'm looking forward to new challenges and opportunities in the field of machine learning!
